## Requirements ##
To use measureit you need the following hardware:

  * a computer
this can be an old home computer that is not longer used. The hardware can be very old. Very old means that 64 MB Ram is more than enough... or a new small laptop that is not consumed much energy.

  * a new mini computer
Measureit run also on small computers like the [Raspberry Pi](http://www.raspberrypi.org/)
This is recommended because of we want to save energy and this small pc does not need much energy.
There is a ready to use image with pre installed measureit available

  * the smart meter cc128 hardware from [currentcost](http://www.currentcost.com/)

The project was designed with the  ["Envi"](http://www.currentcost.com/product-cc128.html) and works also with the ["EnviR"](http://www.currentcost.com/product-envir.html) and the ["Classic"](http://www.currentcost.com/product-theclassic.html)
  * The [Data Cable](http://www.currentcost.com/product-datacable.html) from currentcost to connect to your pc
